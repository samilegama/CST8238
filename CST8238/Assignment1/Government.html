            Three branches work together to govern Canada: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The executive branch (also called the Government) is the decision-making branch, made up of the Monarch (represented by the Governor General), the Prime Minister, and the Cabinet. The legislative branch is the law-making branch, made up of the appointed Senate and the elected House of Commons. The judicial branch is a series of independent courts that interpret the laws passed by the other two branches.

            Parliament itself is made up of the following three parts: the Monarch, the Senate and the House of Commons.
            
            Canada is a constitutional monarchy, which means that we recognize the Queen or King as the Head of State, while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government.

            <h2>The Three Levels of Government</h2>
            <p>
                Canada has three main levels of government.
            </p>
           <h3>1. The federal level </h3>
           <p>This level of government deals with areas of law listed in the Constitution Act, 1867 and that generally affect the whole country.</p>
           
           <h3>2. The provincial level</h3>
           <p>
            In each of the 10 provinces in Canada, the provincial government is responsible for areas listed in the Constitution Act, 1867, such as education, health care, some natural resources, and road regulations. Sometimes they share responsibility with the federal government. The three territories have their own governments, with responsibilities that are given to them by the federal government.
           </p>
           
           <h3>3. The municipal level</h3>
           
           <p>
            This is the level of government that is usually based in a city, town or district (a municipality). Municipal governments are responsible for areas such as libraries, parks, community water systems, local police, roadways and parking. They receive authority for these areas from the provincial governments.

Across the country there are also band councils, which govern First Nations communities. These elected councils make decisions that affect their local communities.     </p>
