           <h2>Discover Canada - Canada Provinces</h2>
           <img style="width:800px;height:400px; " src="https://www.sporcle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-46.jpg" alt="canada government" />
          <h3>Ontario</h3>
          <p>
                The social, economic, environmental and cultural health of Ontario has been shaped largely by the region's geography, its natural resources and its climate. Although most activities in the province are relatively well adapted to current climate conditions, extreme climate events can bring about considerable damage. Climate warming is, and will continue to be, manifested in changes to both average and extreme climate conditions in Ontario. Such recent climate events as drought, flooding, heat waves and warmer winters have resulted in a wide range of impacts in Ontario, including water shortages, forest fires, lower Great Lakes water levels, declines in agricultural production, power outages and outbreaks of water-borne diseases. These impacts have had substantial economic and social costs, raising questions about Ontario's vulnerability to future climate change. The impacts of greatest current concern, both at present and in the future, differ within the various subregions of the province.
          </p>
          <h3>Quebec</h3>
          <p>
                Quebec, the most easterly of the provinces of Canada [this was true before the entrance of Newfoundland into Confederation in 1949], is bounded on the north by Ungava Bay and Hudson straits, on the west by Hudson Bay, James Bay, the Ottawa river, and the province of Ontario, on the south by the states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, and on the east by the Labrador coast and the gulf of St. Lawrence : In 1912 the area of Quebec was exactly doubled, and extended to 703,653 square miles through the annexation of the territory of Ungava; but fifteen years later, in 1927, a decision of the Privy Council gave back to the colony of Newfoundland 102,000 of the 351,780 square miles thus added, leaving an actual present area of 594,534 square miles, which leaves Quebec still the largest of the Canadian provinces. The combined area of France , Germany , and Spain exceeds only by 2,600 square miles that of Quebec .
          </p>
          <h3>Nova Scotia </h3>
          <p>
                Nova Scotia, Canadian province located on the eastern seaboard of North America, one of the four original provinces (along with New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec) that constituted the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Roughly 360 miles (580 km) long but not more than about 80 miles (130 km) wide at any point, the province comprises the peninsula of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island (separated from the mainland to the southwest by the narrow Strait of Canso), and a number of small adjacent islands. Along the narrow Chignecto Isthmus, which seems to thrust the peninsula into the Atlantic Ocean, runs the province’s only land boundary, with New Brunswick to the west. Two arms of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Northumberland and Cabot straits, separate Nova Scotia respectively from Prince Edward Island to the north and the island of Newfoundland to the northeast. To the east and south lies the Atlantic and to the northwest the Bay of Fundy. Halifax is the capital.
          </p>

          <h3>
                New Brunswick
          </h3>
          <p>
                New Brunswick, Canadian province located on the eastern seaboard of the North American continent. It is Canada’s only officially bilingual province, French and English having equal status. It was one of the four original provinces making up the national confederation in 1867. Together with Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, it forms the regional grouping known as the Maritime Provinces. New Brunswick has a roughly rectangular shape, about 210 miles (340 km) from north to south and 185 miles (300 km) from east to west. It is bounded to the north by the province of Quebec, to the east by the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Northumberland Strait, and to the south by the Bay of Fundy. The latter two bodies of water are separated by the narrow neck of the Chignecto Isthmus, which joins New Brunswick to Nova Scotia, to the southeast. To the west lies the U.S. state of Maine.
          </p>
          <h3>
                Manitoba
          </h3>
          <p>
                Manitoba, province of Canada, one of the Prairie Provinces, lying midway between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. The province is bounded to the north by Nunavut territory, to the northeast by Hudson Bay, to the east by Ontario, to the south by the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota, and to the west by Saskatchewan. Manitoba contains more than 100,000 lakes, including Lake Winnipeg, one of the world’s largest inland bodies of fresh water. More than two-fifths of the province’s land area is forested. Winnipeg, Manitoba’s largest city, is the capital. The province’s name comes from an Indian word meaning “the god who speaks.”
          </p>
          <h3>
                British Columbia
          </h3>
          <p>
                British Columbia, westernmost of Canada’s 10 provinces. It is bounded to the north by Yukon and the Northwest Territories, to the east by the province of Alberta, to the south by the U.S. states of Montana, Idaho, and Washington, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the southern panhandle region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It stretches some 730 miles (1,180 km) from north to south and 640 miles (1,030 km) from east to west at its widest point. The land has a diversity of climate and scenery unparalleled in Canada, from the island-studded and fjord-indented coast to the great peaks of the western continental cordilleras, with their large interior plateaus.
          </p>
          <h3>Prince Edward Island</h3>
          <p>
                Prince Edward Island is Canada's smallest province, making up just 0.1 per cent of Canada’s total land area. It is situated in the Gulf of St Lawrence and separated from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick by the Northumberland Strait. PEI was known to its earliest settlers, the Mi’kmaq as Abegweit, meaning "cradle in the waves,” and was described by Jacques Cartier in 1534 as "the fairest land that may possibly be seen." PEI's deep red soil has always been its most striking feature and, together with the sea, the mainstay of the population since the early 18th century. 
          </p>
          <h3>Saskatchewan</h3>
          <p>
                Saskatchewan is part of the Prairie region and is the only province with entirely artificial boundaries. It is bordered by the US to the south, the Northwest Territories to the north, and Manitoba and Alberta to the east and west respectively. It was created from the Northwest Territories in 1905, at the same time as Alberta, and shares with that province the distinction of having no coast on salt water. The name, which was first used officially for a district of the Northwest Territories in 1882, is derived from an anglicized version of a Cree word, kisiskâciwanisîpiy, meaning “swiftly flowing river.”
          </p>
          <h3>
                Alberta
          </h3>
          <p>
                Alberta is one of Canada's provinces. It celebrated 100 years as a province in 2005 on September 1st. As part of the Centennial celebration, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the province from May 23 to May 25, 2005.

                Alberta's capital is the city of Edmonton. Its most populous city and metropolitan area, Calgary, is Alberta's commerce centre and is located in the southern region of the province. Other major cities and towns include Banff, Camrose, Wetaskiwin, Fort McMurray, Grande Prairie, Jasper, Lethbridge, Lloydminster, Medicine Hat, and Red Deer.
                
                The Premier of the province is Ralph Klein.
                
                Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848-1939), the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. Princess Louise was also the wife of Sir John Campbell, who was the Governor General of Canada from 1878-1883. Lake Louise was also named in honour of Princess Louise.
          </p>
          <h3>
                Newfoundland and Labrador
          </h3>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador, province of Canada composed of the island of Newfoundland and a larger mainland sector, Labrador, to the northwest. It is the newest of Canada’s 10 provinces, having joined the confederation only in 1949; its name was officially changed to Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001. The island, which was named the “newfoundelande,” or New Found Land, by late 15th-century explorers, lies athwart the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is separated from Labrador by the narrow Strait of Belle Isle and from Nova Scotia, to the southwest, by Cabot Strait. The French territory of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon lies off the coast of the Burin Peninsula in southeastern Newfoundland. Labrador is bordered to the north and east by the Labrador Sea (northwestern arm of the Atlantic Ocean) and to the south and west by the province of Quebec.</p>
