           <h3>Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve</h3>
           <p>
                Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve is a proposed national park reserve in the Labrador region of Newfoundland and Labrador. Its area would cover approximately 10,700 square kilometres (4,131 sq mi),[1] and be known officially as Akami–uapishku-KakKasuak-Mealy Mountains National Park Reserve. Along with the Mealy Mountains, the park will protect a large portion of boreal forest, tundra and 50 kilometres of shoreline on the Labrador Sea.[2] Once established, it will be the largest national park in eastern Canada.[3] It is inhabited by a variety of wildlife, including the threatened Mealy Mountains woodland caribou herd.[2] Other mammals that inhabit this park reserve are wolf packs, black bear, marten and two species of fox. An agreement with the native peoples of the area, including the Inuit, Innu and NunatuKavut will allow them to continue to hunt, trap and fish in the protected area

           <h3>Aulavik National Park</h3>
           <p>
                Aulavik National Park (Inuvialuktun: place where people travel) is a national park located on Banks Island in the Northwest Territories of Canada.[1] It is known for its access to the Thomsen River, one of the most northerly navigable rivers in North America.[1] The park is a fly-in park, and protects approximately 12,274 square kilometres (4,739 sq mi) of Arctic Lowlands at the northern end of the island.[1][2] The most practical way to visit the park is to charter a plane,[2] and currently the park has four landing sites.[3] Aulavik is considered a polar desert and often experiences high winds. Precipitation for the park is approximately 300 mm (12 in) per year.[4] In the southern regions of the park a sparsely vegetated upland plateau reaches a height of 450 m (1,480 ft) above sea level.

           <h3>Auyuittuq National Park</h3>
           <p>
                Auyuittuq National Park (Inuktitut: ᐊᐅᔪᐃᑦᑐᖅ, IPA: [aujuitːuq], "the land that never melts") is a national park located on Baffin Island's Cumberland Peninsula, Qikiqtaaluk Region in Nunavut, the largest political subdivision of Canada. The park was initially known as Baffin Island National Park when it was established in 1972, but the name was changed in 1976 to its current name to better reflect the region and its history. It features many terrains of Arctic wilderness, such as fjords, glaciers, and ice fields. Although Auyuittuq was established in 1972 as a national park reserve, it was upgraded to a full national park in 2000.
           </p>
           <h3>Banff National Park</h3>
           <p>

The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.

           <p>
                Cape Breton Highlands National Park (official name: Cape Breton Highlands National Park of Canada)[2] (French: Parc national du Canada des Hautes-Terres-du-Cap-Breton) is a Canadian national park located on northern Cape Breton Island in the province of Nova Scotia. One-third of the Cabot Trail passes through the park featuring spectacular ocean and mountain views. The park is well known for its "steep cliffs and deep river canyons that carve into a forested plateau bordering the Atlantic Ocean".[3] The park was the first national park in the Atlantic provinces of Canada[4] and covers an area of 948 square kilometres (366 sq mi).[5] It is one of 42 in Canada's system of national parks.

                Elk Island National Park
           </h3>
           <p>
                Elk Island National Park (French: parc national Elk Island) is a national park in Canada that played an important part in the conservation of the American bison. The park is administered by the Parks Canada Agency. This "island of conservation" is located 35 km east of Edmonton, Alberta along the Yellowhead Highway, which goes through the park. It is Canada's 8th smallest in area but largest fully enclosed national park, with an area of 194 square kilometres (75 sq mi).

           <h3>
                Forillon National Park
           </h3>
           <p>
                Forillon National Park (French: Parc national Forillon), one of 42 national parks and park reserves across Canada, is located at the outer tip of the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec and covers 244 km2 (94 sq mi).[2] Created in 1970, Forillon was the first national park in Quebec. The park includes forests, sea coast, salt marshes, sand dunes, cliffs, and the Eastern End of the Appalachians. The word forillon is thought to have referred to a flowerpot island or sea stack which used to be a landmark in the area but has since collapsed into the ocean.

           <h3>
                Glacier National Park
           </h3>

           <p>
                Glacier National Park is part of a system of 43 parks and park reserves across Canada, and one of seven national parks in British Columbia. Established in 1886, the park encompasses 1,349 km2 (521 sq mi), and includes a portion of the Columbia Mountains. It also contains the Rogers Pass National Historic Site.
           </p>
           <p>
                The park's history is closely tied to two primary Canadian transportation routes, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), completed in 1885, and the Trans-Canada Highway, completed in 1963. The pass in the centre of the park eluded explorers until 1881. The railway brought with it tourism, the establishment of Glacier National Park and the construction of a popular alpine hotel. The heavy winter snows and steep, avalanche-prone valleys of the park have been a major obstacle to transportation, necessitating much railway engineering and avalanche control measures.

           <h3>
                Grasslands National Park

           </p>
           <h3>Ivvavik National Park</h3>
           <p>
                Ivvavik National Park is located in Yukon, Canada. Initially named "Northern Yukon National Park," the park was renamed Ivvavik in 1992 for the Inuvialuktun word meaning "nursery" or "birthplace,"[1] in reference to the importance of the area as a calving ground for caribou.[2] Created as a result of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement in 1984, negotiated between the Canadian Government and the Inuvialuit of the Northern Yukon, Ivvavik is the first national park in Canada to be established as a result of an aboriginal land claims agreement.
